My name is Vikram Venkataramanan. I am a software developer based in Toronto. 

After finishing up my computer science degree, I dabbled around a bit writing low-level code for high-performance software defined radios. 

Nowadays I spend my time constructing and maintaining ecobeeâ€™s subscription platform.
